    <h1>Giant panda</h1>
    <p>
      The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a
      bear native to south central China. It is characterised by large, black
      patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The
      name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda,
      a neighboring musteloid.
